# RaineTween
RaineTween is a client tweening system for Roblox which allows for smooth tweens.
By moving the responsibility of tweening from the server to the client, it allows for a [much smoother tween](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/tweening-on-the-client/1472967/4).

RaineTween currently supports the methods provided by TweenService.

If you notice a possible performance issue, stupid thing in my code, or a memory leak, please notify me immediately.
